## ABOUT US

In 2035, Africa will have the largest workforce in the world and will need to catalyze transformation by empowering its largest untapped resource - its people.
Fueled by this, the [African Leadership Group](https://algroup.org/) is an ecosystem of institutions with a shared vision to harness Africa's abundant human capital and transform the continent and the world by selecting, developing, and connecting 2 million young leaders to opportunities by 2030.
ALG was founded over 15 years ago by [Fred Swaniker](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567703/fred-swaniker/), a serial entrepreneur recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.
ALX and The Room are two brands of the [African Leadership Group](https://algroup.org/). 


**ALX is our training arm**, focused on developing skills for the fourth industrial revolution (software engineering, devops, data science, etc.) to ensure that Africa is able to compete effectively as the world undergoes a digital transformation.
To cement this, through our legal entity  African Leadership International (ALI), we have signed an agreement to acquire Silicon Valley based Holberton Inc. – a project-based, college alternative educating the next generation of software engineers.
This will give us ownership of the advanced technology program that will enable us to provide global organizations access to significant untapped pools of talent that can bridge the growing global shortage of technology talent.
